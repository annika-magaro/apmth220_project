## Description ##
This is the repo for my final project. There are two main directories. 
## Distortions ##
In the distortions directory you'll find the code to generate the distorted speech that I'd previously written. 
## Code written for project ##
In the other directory you'll find the code that I specifically wrote for this project, which includes the validation dataset generation, the plots, and the code to perform PCA on the model representations.
